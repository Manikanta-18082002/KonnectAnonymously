# KonnectAnonymously
Users of this application can post their secrets anonymously, and others can view them in a public thread. User data is stored using MongoDB and Mongoose and was created using node.js/express. Facebook and Google login are used.

Passport.js, along with GoogleAuth and FacebookAuth, is used by the application to authenticate users. Since environment variables are used throughout the code, it may be necessary to replace them with custom values in order to run the code.
